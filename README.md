Right now, this folder holds files from an analysis of startup funding data. See seed-funding-analysis.Rmd for a description.
<b> Summary
<s>When companies use words like “paradigm-shift”, does it influence their ability to get seed funding from investors? I looked at startup funding data from Crunchbase to find relationships between the words in company descriptions and the initial seed funding. These descriptions are written by the companies themselves and are a good proxy for the “elevator pitch” that would be given to investors. Multiple hypothesis tests revealed which words had a statistically significant relationship with funding. Some, such as “data”, “security”, and “music” identified market trends over that time period, but others, such as “leading” and “transform”, associated with increased funding, and “community”, associated with less funding, were more interesting, and deserving of additional exploration. In future work, I would like to obtain company descriptions and find additional predictive features by web scraping, and match those descriptions with the time that the seed funding was given. Additionally, I plan to build a statistical model that uses this data to predict seed funding. This model will useful to startups looking for effective ways to market themselves to investors.
